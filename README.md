# Prisha Gupta — Portfolio Website

A modern, premium personal portfolio website built with a **minimal + pastel** design system and a **scrapbook-inspired aesthetic** — because this style genuinely resonates with me and reflects my creative side while still keeping everything clean, professional, and recruiter-friendly.

This portfolio highlights my **projects, skills, experience, and achievements** with smooth interactions, subtle motion, and performance-focused UI.
